INTRODUCTION                                    *diffchanges* *diffchanges.vim*

The diffchanges plugin shows changes made to a buffer since the last save to
disk. It provides commands for showing changes using vimdiff and as a patch,
and a command to write a patch (without viewing it).

COMMANDS                                               *diffchanges-commands*

:DiffChanges [FILENAME]    Write a patch to FILENAME. If FILENAME is not
                           given, a unique one will be generated.

:DiffChangesDiffToggle     Toggles diff mode. Changes are shown using vimdiff.

:DiffChangesPatchToggle    Toggles patch mode. Changes are show as a unified
                           diff in another window.

CONFIGURATION                                     *diffchanges-configuration*

g:diffchanges_loaded                                   *g:diffchanges_loaded*
    If set in your |vimrc|, diffchanges.vim is not loaded.

g:diffchanges_patch_cmd                             *g:diffchanges_patch_cmd*
    This command will be used to generate the diff in patch mode. It defaults
    to 'diff -u'.
